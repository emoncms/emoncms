    $ git pull origin master
    
Make a copy of your current settings.php file and create a new settings.php file from default.settings.php. Enter your emoncms database settings.
Add the line:
 
    $updatelogin = true;
    
to settings.php to enable a special database update only session, be sure to remove this line from settings.php once complete.

    http://localhost/emoncms/admin/view
    
Click on the database update and check button to launch the database update script.

You may at this point want to backup your input and users table before applying the changes.

That should be it.
