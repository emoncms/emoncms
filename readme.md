[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emoncms/emoncms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emoncms/emoncms)

Emoncms is an open-source web application for processing, logging and visualising energy, temperature and other environmental data and is part of the [OpenEnergyMonitor project](http://openenergymonitor.org).

## Branches

* [master](https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms) - The latest and greatest developments. Potential bugs, use at your own risk!  [EmonCMS 9.x forum thread](http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/11009)

* [stable](https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/tree/stable) - emonPi/emonBase release branch, regularly merged from master. Slightly more tried and tested. [See change log](https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/releases)

* ARCHIVE [low-write (v8.5)](https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/tree/low-write) - Old emonpi/emonbase emoncms version ([July 15 emonSD ready-to-go SD card image](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonpi/wiki/emonSD-pre-built-SD-card-Download-&-Change-Log)). Low-write mode is now available in v9.0. The low write version of emoncms is designed for running on SD cards. This is a cut down version of emoncms supports only the phpfina and phptimeseries feed engines (no in built feed averaging or histograms) and a reduced input processor set. **Archived branch**

## Modules

Modules can be installed by downloading or git cloning into the emoncms/Modules folder. Be sure to check for database updates in Administration menu after installing new modules:

- [Dashboards module](https://github.com/emoncms/dashboard), required for creating, viewing and publishing dashboards: 

- [App Module](https://github.com/emoncms/app.git) - Application specific dashboards e.g. MyElectric, MySolar
    
- [Config]( https://github.com/emoncms/config.git) - In-browser emonhub.conf editor and emonhub.log log viewer. git clone
    
- [Wifi Module]( https://github.com/emoncms/wifi.git) - [Wifi configuration interface designed for use on the emonPi](https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/setup/connect/)

There are many other modules such as the event module and openbem (open source building energy modelling module) that are available, check out the [Emoncms repo list](https://github.com/emoncms)
