####Installation:
Update your emoncms installation to ensure that the necessary files are downloaded:

    cd /var/www/html/emoncms && git pull

Make the installation script executable:

    cd /var/www/html/emoncms/scripts/logger/ && sudo chmod +x install.sh

Run the installation script:

    sudo ./install.sh

Provided that the directory /var/log has been successfully mounted in tmpfs, a system reboot is necessary to complete the process.
