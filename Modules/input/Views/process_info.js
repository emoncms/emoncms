    '1':"<p><b>Log to feed:</b> This processor logs the current selected input to a timeseries feed which can then be used to explore historic data. This is recommended for logging power, temperature, humidity, voltage and current data.</p><p><b>Feed engine:</b> The fixed interval with averaging (PHPFIWA) feed engine is the recommended engine to use for logging power, temperature, humidity, voltage and current data. In addition to storing the full resolution data it produces a series of downsampled averaged layers which gives a more accurate representation of the data when viewing the data over a large time range.</p><p><b>Feed interval:</b> When selecting the feed interval select an interval that is the same as, or longer than the update rate that is set in your monitoring equipment. Setting the interval rate to be shorter than the update rate of the equipment causes un-needed disk space to be used up.</p><p><b>SD Card use:</b> For SD Card use however its recommended to use the fixed interval without averaging feed engine (PHPFINA) as the number of disk writes per datapoint is much less (although could still be improved), lengthening SD card life.",
